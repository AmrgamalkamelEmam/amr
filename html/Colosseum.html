            <p class="colos">Colosseo [kolosˈsɛːo]) is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome,
                 Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is
                 still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world today, despite its age. Construction began
                 under the emperor Vespasian <span>(r. 69–79 AD)</span> in <span>72</span> and was completed in 
                 <span>80</span> AD under his successor and heir, Titus <span>(r. 79–81)</span>. Further modifications
                  were made during the reign of Domitian <span>(r. 81–96)</span>. The three emperors that were patrons 
                  of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre 
                  (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio [aɱfiteˈaːtro ˈflaːvjo]) by later classicists
                   and archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius)</p>

            <p class="nname">Originally, the building's Latin name was simply the Latin:<span> amphitheatrum, 'amphitheatre'</span>.
                 Though the modern name Flavian Amphitheatre <span>(Latin: amphitheatrum Flavium)</span> is often used, there is no 
                 evidence it was used in Classical Antiquity. This name refers to the patronage of the Flavian dynasty, 
                 during whose reigns the building was constructed, but the structure is better known as the Colosseum. 
                 In antiquity, Romans may have referred to the Colosseum by the unofficial name Amphitheatrum Caesareum 
                 <span>(with Caesareum an adjective pertaining to the title Caesar)</span>, but this name may have been strictly poetic 
                 as it was not exclusive to the Colosseum; Vespasian and Titus, builders of the Colosseum, also constructed 
                 a Flavian Amphitheatre in Puteoli <span>(modern Pozzuoli)</span>.<br><br>
                The name <span>Colosseum</span> is believed to be derived from a colossal statue of Nero on the model of the <span>Colossus of 
                Rhodes</span>. The giant bronze sculpture of Nero as a solar deity was moved to its position beside the amphitheatre 
                by the emperor Hadrian <span>(r. 117–138)</span>. The word colosseum is a neuter Latin noun formed from the adjective 
                colosseus, meaning <span>"gigantic"</span> or <span>"colossean"</span>. By the year <span>1000</span> the Latin name 
                <span>"Colosseum"</span> had been coined to refer to the amphitheatre from the nearby <span>"Colossus Solis"</span>.</p>

                <p class="history11">The site chosen was a flat area on the floor of a low valley between the Caelian, 
                    Esquiline and Palatine Hills, through which a canalised stream ran as well as an artificial lake/marsh. 
                    By the 2nd century BC the area was densely inhabited. It was devastated by the Great Fire of Rome in 
                    <span>64 AD</span>, following which <span>Nero</span> seized much of the area to add to his personal domain. He built the grandiose 
                    <span>Domus Aurea</span> on the site, in front of which he created an artificial lake surrounded by pavilions, gardens and 
                    porticoes. The existing <span>Aqua Claudia</span> aqueduct was extended to supply water to the area and the gigantic 
                    bronze Colossus of <span>Nero</span> was set up nearby at the entrance to the <span>Domus Aurea</span>.<br>
                    Although the Colossus was preserved, much of the <span>Domus Aurea</span> was torn down. The lake was filled in and the 
                    land reused as the location for the new <span>Flavian</span> Amphitheatre. <span>Gladiatorial</span> schools and other support 
                    buildings were constructed nearby within the former grounds of the <span>Domus Aurea</span>. Vespasian's decision 
                    to build the <span>Colosseum</span> on the site of Nero's lake can be seen as a populist gesture of returning to the 
                    people an area of the city which Nero had appropriated for his own use. In contrast to many other 
                    amphitheatres, which were on the outskirts of a city, the Colosseum was constructed in the city centre, 
                    in effect, placing it both symbolically and precisely at the heart of Rome.</p> <br><br>

                <p class="history2" id="hhh2">Medieval</p>
                <p class="history22">The Colosseum underwent several radical changes of use. By the late <span>6th</span> century 
                    a small chapel had been built into the structure of the amphitheater, though this apparently 
                    did not confer any particular religious significance on the building as a whole. The arena 
                    was converted into a cemetery. The numerous vaulted spaces in the arcades under the seating 
                    were converted into housing and workshops, and are recorded as still being rented out as 
                    late as the <span>12th</span> century. Around <span>1200</span> the Frangipani family took over 
                    the Colosseum and fortified it, apparently using it as a castle.<br>
                    Severe damage was inflicted on the Colosseum by the great earthquake in <span>1349</span>, 
                    causing the outer south side, lying on a less stable alluvial terrain, to collapse. 
                    Much of the tumbled stone was reused to build palaces, churches, hospitals and other 
                    buildings elsewhere in Rome. A religious order moved into the northern third of the 
                    Colosseum in the <span>mid-14th</span> century and continued to inhabit it until as late 
                    as the early <span>19th</span> century. The interior of the amphitheater was extensively 
                    stripped of stone, which was reused elsewhere, or (in the case of the marble façade) was 
                    burned to make quicklime. The iron clamps which held the stonework together were pried or 
                    hacked out of the walls, leaving numerous pockmarks which still scar the building today.</p> <br><br>

                <p class="history33">During the <span>16th</span> and <span>17th</span> century, Church officials sought a 
                    productive role for the Colosseum. Pope Sixtus V <span>(1585–1590)</span> planned to turn the building 
                    into a wool factory to provide employment for Rome's prostitutes, though this proposal fell through with 
                    his premature death. In <span>1671</span> Cardinal Altieri authorized its use for bullfights; a public 
                    outcry caused the idea to be hastily abandoned.<br>
                    Allied troops consult a guidebook outside the Colosseum after liberation in <span>1944</span> In <span>1749</span>, 
                    Pope Benedict XIV endorsed the view that the Colosseum was a sacred site where early Christians had been martyred. 
                    He forbade the use of the Colosseum as a quarry and consecrated the building to the Passion of Christ and 
                    installed Stations of the Cross, declaring it sanctified by the blood of the Christian martyrs who perished there 
                    (see Significance in Christianity). However, there is no historical evidence to support Benedict's claim, 
                    nor is there even any evidence that anyone before the <span>16th</span> century suggested this might be the case; 
                    the Catholic Encyclopedia concludes that there are no historical grounds for the supposition, other than the 
                    reasonably plausible conjecture that some of the many martyrs may well have been</p><br><br>

                    is an entirely free-standing structure. It derives its basic exterior and interior 
                    architecture from that of two theatres back to back. It is elliptical in plan and 
                    is <span>189</span> meters <span>(615 ft / 640 Roman feet)</span> long, and <span>156</span>

                    square metres <span>(6 acres)</span>. The height of the outer wall is <span>48 meters (157 ft / 165 Roman feet)</span>. 
                    The perimeter originally measured <span>545 meters (1,788 ft / 1,835 Roman feet)</span>. The central arena is 
                    an oval <span>87 m (287 ft)</span> long and <span>55 m (180 ft)</span> wide, surrounded by a wall

                    They were seated in a tiered arrangement that reflected the rigidly stratified nature of Roman 
                    society. Special boxes were provided at the north and south ends respectively for the Emperor 
                    and the Vestal Virgins, providing the best views of the arena. Flanking them at the same level 
                    was a broad platform or podium for the senatorial class, who were allowed to bring their own 
                    chairs. The names of some <span>5th</span> century senators can still be seen carved into the 
                    stonework, presumably reserving areas for their use.</p> <br><br>

                    280 by 163 Roman feet)</span>. It comprised a wooden floor covered by sand <span>(the Latin word 
                    for sand is harena or arena)</span>, covering an elaborate underground structure called the 
                    <span>hypogeum (literally meaning "underground")</span>. The hypogeum was not part of the original construction 
                    but was ordered to be built by Emperor Domitian. Little now remains of the original arena floor, 
                    but the hypogeum is still clearly visible. It consisted of a two-level subterranean network of 
                    tunnels and cages beneath the arena where gladiators and animals were held before contests began. 
                    Eighty vertical shafts provided instant access to the arena for caged animals and scenery pieces 
                    concealed underneath; larger hinged platforms, called <span>hegmata</span>, provided access for elephants and the

            <p class="usee">The Colosseum was used to host gladiatorial shows as well as a variety of other events. 
                The shows, called munera, were always given by private individuals rather than the state. They had 
                a strong religious element but were also demonstrations of power and family prestige, and were 
                immensely popular with the population. Another popular type of show was the animal hunt, or venatio. 
                This utilized a great variety of wild beasts, mainly imported from Africa and the Middle East, and 
                included creatures such as rhinoceros, hippopotamuses, elephants, giraffes, aurochs, wisents, Barbary 
                lions, panthers, leopards, bears, Caspian tigers, crocodiles and ostriches. Battles and hunts were 
                often staged amid elaborate sets with movable trees and buildings. Such events were occasionally on 
                a huge scale; Trajan is said to have celebrated his victories in Dacia in 107 with contests involving 
                <span>11,000</span> animals and <span>10,000</span> gladiators over the course of <span>123</span> days. 
                During lunch intervals, executions ad bestias would be staged. Those condemned to death would be sent 
                into the arena, naked and unarmed, to face the beasts of death which would literally tear them to pieces. 
                Other performances would also take place by acrobats and magicians, typically during the intervals.</p><br><br>

        <p class="his" id="non1">HISTORY OF THE MALDIVES</p>
        <br>
        <p class="hiss" id="ono1">The history of the Maldives is intertwined with the history of the broader Indian subcontinent and the surrounding regions, 
        comprising the areas of South Asia and Indian Ocean; and the modern nation consisting of 26 natural atolls, comprising 1194 islands.
         Historically, the Maldives had a strategic importance because of its location on the major marine routes of the Indian Ocean.
         The Maldives' nearest neighbours are the British Indian Ocean Territory, Sri Lanka and India. The United Kingdom, Sri Lanka and some 
         Indian kingdoms have had cultural and economic ties with the Maldives for centuries. In addition to these countries, 
         Maldivians also traded with Aceh and many other kingdoms in, what is today, Indonesia and Malaysia. The Maldives provided
        the main source of cowrie shells, then used as a currency throughout Asia and parts of the East African coast. 
        Most probably Maldives were influenced by Kalingas of ancient India who were earliest sea traders to Sri Lanka and 
        the Maldives from India and were responsible for the spread of Buddhism. Stashes of Chinese crockery found buried in 
        various locations in the Maldives also show that there was direct or indirect trade contact between China and the Maldives.
        In 1411 and 1430, the Chinese admiral Zheng He visited the Maldives. The Chinese also became the first country to establish
        a diplomatic office in the Maldives, when the Chinese nationalist government based in Taipei opened an embassy in Malé in 1966.
         This office has since been replaced by the embassy of the People's Republic of China.After the 16th century, when colonial powers took over much 
         of the trade in the Indian Ocean, first the Portuguese, then the Dutch, and the French occasionally meddled in local politics. However, this
        interference ended when the Maldives became a British Protectorate in the 19th century and the Maldivian monarchs were granted a good measure 
        of self-governance.[citation needed]The Maldives gained total independence from the British on 26 July 1965. However, 
        the British continued to maintain an air base on the island of Gan in the southernmost atoll until 1976.
        The British departure in 1976 at the height of the Cold War almost immediately triggered foreign speculation about the future of the air base.
        The Soviet Union requested the use of the base, but the Maldives refused.The greatest challenge facing the republic in the early 1990s was 
        the need for rapid economic development and modernisation, given the country's limited resource base in fishing and tourism. Concern was 
        also evident over a projected long-term sea level rise, which would prove disastrous to the low-lying coral islands.</p>

        <br> 
        <p class="nname">Maldives has been known by many different names during its long history of more than two 
        thousand years.Although several different names are given, the location and the description of the islands confirm the 
        fact that they are part of the Maldives Archipelago.In ancient times Malé was also called Mahal, 
        considered to be the origin of Mahal Dvipa or Maléldvip. Throughout known history, Malé or Mahal was 
        always the most important island, the island where the king resided. It is therefore a logical assumption 
        that the name given to the islands, Mahal Dvipa, contained a reference to the chief island of Mahal.. A study 
        of the names shows that in the 9th, 10th and 11th centuries, the original Mahal Dvipa became Arabicised by Middle 
        Eastern travellers, to Mahaldib, and later became Anglicised by the British Empire to emerge in its present form of Maldives.
        However, throughout history the Maldivians have used the name Dhivehi Raajje to refer to their country, meaning 
        'the country of the Dhivehi people</p> <br>

        <p class="pp">officially the Republic of Maldives
        , is an archipelagic country in the Indian subcontinentof Asia, 
        situated in the Indian Ocean. It lies southwest of Sri Lanka and India, about 750 kilometres 
        (470 miles; 400 nautical miles)from the Asian continent's mainland. The chain of 26 atolls 
        stretches fromIhavandhippolhu Atoll in the north to Addu Atollin the south (across the Equator).

        <p>
            the conversion of the Maldives to Islam happened relatively late. Arab Traders had converted populations in the 
            Malabar Coast since the 7th century, and the Muslim General Muhammad Bin Qāsim had converted of Sindh and Southern 
            Punjab to Islam at about the same time. The Maldives remained a Buddhist kingdom for another five hundred years 
            (perhaps the south-westernmost Buddhist country) until the conversion to Islam

        <p>Environmental issues other than sea level rise include bad waste 
            disposal and beach theft. Although the Maldives are kept relatively pristine and little 
            litter can be found on the islands, no good waste disposal sites exist. Most trash from
            Malé and other resorts is simply dumped at the Thilafushi landfill.<br>

        <p id="clim">CLIMATE</p><br>
        <p id="cclim">The Maldives has a tropical monsoon climate (Am) under the Köppen climate classification, which is affected by 
        the large landmass of South Asia to the north. Because the Maldives has the lowest elevation of any country in
        the world, the temperature is constantly hot and often humid. The presence of this landmass causes differential
        heating of land and water. These factors set off a rush of moisture-rich air from the Indian Ocean over South Asia,
        resulting in the southwest monsoon. Two seasons dominate Maldives' weather: the dry season associated with the winter
        northeastern monsoon and the rainy season associated with the southwest monsoon which brings strong winds and storms.

    At first glance, the Valley of the Kings, also known as the Valley of the Gates of the Kings, seems like no more than a sun-blasted gorge of generic red rock, but underneath all of its dust lay the tombs of 63 of the most important pharaohs in the history of Ancient Egypt. Used as a burial chamber for nearly 500 years from the 16th to 11th century BC, the Valley of the Kings was used for royal burials for the Kings, their families, and their possessions. In 1979, it became a World Heritage Site, as well as the rest of the Theban Necropolis.

<h2 class="tit">Description and location </h2>
<p class="paragraph">

     The Valley of the Kings is a narrow closed valley located on the land of the Nile, behind the rocks of Thebes (Luxor). The road that leads to the Valley of the Kings from Luxor, after crossing the Nile, is a long road that crosses the plain, passing through the Temple of Seti I in the village of Qurna, and then bends to the west on a rocky road of many bends. The length of this road is about 5 kilometers.

<h2 class="tit">History</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
    
    After the reunification of Egypt, the ancient civilization entered the New Kingdom (c. 1550 BCE to c. 1077 BCE); it was a period of incredible wealth and prosperity. It was during this time that pharaohs sought out even more elaborate tombs that would demonstrate their influence. This led the earliest pharaohs to construct the first tombs at the Valley of the Kings.
    
    It was there, behind the Theban Hills, that the pharaohs could create complex structures filled with riches for the afterlife. The particularly remote location of the site was probably a key factor, as it allowed the area to be more easily guarded against robbers.
    
    In ancient times, its official name was The Great and Majestic Necropolis of the Millions of Years of the Pharaoh, Life, Strength, Health, in The West of Thebes, or Ta-sekhet-ma'at (“The Great Field”)
    The 63 known tombs at the site are all rock-cut tombs, which is a type of the valley that is made directly into a natural rock formation. Each of these varies greatly in size and complexity. Some tombs contain over 120 chambers while others accommodate only one.
    
    Although the earlier tombs tend to exhibit a “bent axis” (in which the corridors turn 90 degrees at least once), the later tombs from the 19th and 20th Dynasties have a much straighter design
    Although the Valley of the Kings was plundered by tomb robbers hundreds of years ago—and therefore removed a majority of precious objects from the site—the interior decoration still demonstrates the power and influence of the pharaohs.
    
    Most of the burial chambers are decorated with scenes from different ancient religious texts, such as the Book of Gates, the Book of Caverns, and the Book of the Earth. The purpose of this art was to help the person on their journey to the afterlife.

<h2 class="tit">Tourism</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
    Most of the tombs are not open to the public (18 of the tombs can be opened, but they are rarely open at the same time), and officials occasionally close those that are open for restoration work. The number of visitors to KV62 has led to a separate charge for entry into the tomb. The West Valley has only one open tomb—that of Ay—and a separate ticket is needed to visit this tomb.The tour guides are no longer allowed to lecture inside the tombs, and visitors are expected to proceed quietly and in single file through the tombs. This is to minimize time in the tombs and prevent the crowds from damaging the surfaces of the decoration.
    
    In 1997, 58 tourists and four Egyptians were massacred at nearby Deir el-Bahari by Islamist militants from Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya. This led to an overall drop in tourism in the area.
    
    On most days of the week an average of 4,000 to 5,000 tourists visit the main valley. The West Valley is much less visited, as there is only one tomb that is open to the public.

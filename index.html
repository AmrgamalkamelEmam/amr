<h4 id="t1" class="amr"> About the pyramids</h4>  <br><p>Pyramids Giza, Arabic Ahrāmāt Al-Jīzah, Giza also spelled Gizeh, three 4th-dynasty <b>(2575-c. 2465 BCE)</b> pyramids erected on a rocky plateau on the west bank of the Nile River near Al-Jīzah<b >(Giza)</b> northern Egypt. In ancient times they were included among the Seven Wonders of the World. The ancient ruins of the Memphis area, including the Pyramids of Giza, Ṣaqqārah, Dahshūr, Abū Ruwaysh, and Abū Ṣīr, were collectively designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1979.
    The designations of the pyramids—Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure—correspond to the kings for whom they were built. The northernmost and oldest pyramid of the group was built for Khufu (Greek: Cheops), the second king of the 4th dynasty. Called the Great Pyramid, it is the
     largest of the three, the length of each side at the base averaging 755.75 feet <b>(230 metres)</b> and its original height being 481.4 feet it is equal in the unite meter <br><b>(147 metres). </b> middle pyramid was built for Khafre 
     (Greek: Chephren), the fourth of the eight kings of the 4th dynasty; the structure measures 707.75 feet <b>(216 metres) </b> each side and was originally 471 feet (143 metres) high. The southernmost and last pyramid to be built was that of Menkaure (Greek: Mykerinus), the fifth king of the 4th dynasty; each side measures 356.5 feet <b>(109 metres),</b> and the structure’s completed
      height was 218 feet <b>(66 metres).</b> All three pyramids were plundered both internally and externally in ancient and medieval times. Thus, the grave goods originally deposited in the burial chambers are missing, and the pyramids no longer reach their original heights because they have been almost entirely stripped of their outer casings of smooth white limestone; 
    the Great Pyramid, for example, is now only 451.4 feet<b>(138 metres)</b> high. That of Khafre retains the outer limestone casing only at its topmost portion. Constructed near each pyramid was a mortuary temple, which was linked via a sloping causeway to a valley temple on the edge of the Nile floodplain. Also nearby were subsidiary pyramids used for the burials of other members of the royal family.</p>
<br>
<h4 id="t2" class="amr">    The location of the pyramids</h4><br><p>  Most of the Egyptian pyramids are located near Cairo, and most of them are concentrated in the south of Cairo, <b>(60 km )</b> the city. The pyramids are distributed within a group of large tombs or funerary cities as they are called, which are spread throughout the various areas of Cairo, including; Abu Rawash, Giza, Zawiya Al-Arian, Abu Sir, Saqqara, Al-Leach, and Dahshur. It is noteworthy that the number of royal pyramids
   <b> ( reaches 54. )</b>
 </p> <br><h4  id="t3" class="amr">
    The main pyramids in Egypt</h4> <br>
    <ul>
<li  class="amr"><h5> Khufu pyramid</h5></li>
<p>  It is known as the Great Pyramid of Giza; It is the largest of the three main pyramids in Giza, and it is the only pyramid that was classified as one of<b> (the Seven Wonders)</b> of the Ancient World, and represents the 
    tomb of Pharaoh Khufu . the bulding is continous<br> Between 10 to 20 years old), the pyramid is surrounded by many major edifices, including:<b>( 3 pyramids)</b> belonging to the wives of King Khufu, two temples, in addition to a small pyramid belonging to the Great Pyramid, and small terraced tombs.  </p>
<li class="amr"><h5> Khafre`s pyramid</h5></li>
<p> The pyramid of Khafre is the second largest of the three pyramids of Giza after the pyramid of Khufu, where the pharaoh Khafre, son of King Khufu was buried. The pyramid of Khafre is famous for having the Sphinx as an external part of it. The pyramid is located <br><b>(160 m )</b> of the Great Pyramid, with a base area of<b>( ​​210.5 meters)</b>. With a height of 135.5 meters, it is noteworthy that the pyramid appears at first sight larger than the pyramid of King Khufu due to the height of the land on which it was built, 
    and the top of the pyramid still retains its external structure of limestone, and the distinctive design of the funerary temple can be distinguished from the eastern side of the pyramid.  </p>
<li class="amr"><h5>Menkaure pyramid</h5></li>
<p>  It is the third main pyramid of the pyramids of Giza, and was built to be the tomb of Pharaoh Menkaure, and is the smallest of the three pyramids of Giza in terms of size, however, it is considered a huge structure with a height of up to<b> (62 meters)</b>, and a base length of up to <b>( 108 meters)</b>, as it was built of large limestone It is reported that, on the southern side of the pyramid, there are <br><b>( 3 smaller)</b>, incompletely built pyramids, which constitute the tombs of Pharaoh Menkaure's relatives.
